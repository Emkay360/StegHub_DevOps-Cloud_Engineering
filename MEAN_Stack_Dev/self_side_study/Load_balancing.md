## What is a Load Balancer?
A load balancer is a solution that acts as a traffic proxy and distributes network or application traffic across endpoints on several servers. Load balancers are used to distribute capacity during peak traffic times, and to increase the reliability of applications. They improve the overall performance of applications by decreasing the burden on individual services or clouds and distributing the demand across different compute surfaces to help maintain application and network sessions. 

### Benefits of Load Balancing
Load balancing directs and controls internet traffic between the application servers and their visitors or clients. As a result, it improves an applicationâ€™s availability, scalability, security, and performance.

__1. Application availability__

Server failure or maintenance can increase application downtime, making your application unavailable to visitors. Load balancers increase the fault tolerance of your systems by automatically detecting server problems and redirecting client traffic to available servers. You can use load balancing to make these tasks easier:

- Run application server maintenance or upgrades without application downtime
- Provide automatic disaster recovery to backup sites
- Perform health checks and prevent issues that can cause downtime.

__2. Application scalability__

You can use load balancers to direct network traffic intelligently among multiple servers. Your applications can handle thousands of client requests because load balancing does the following:

- Prevents traffic bottlenecks at any one server
- Predicts application traffic so that you can add or remove different servers if needed
- Adds redundancy to your system so that you can scale with confidence.

__3. Application security__

Load balancers come with built-in security features to add another layer of security to your internet applications. They are a useful tool to deal with distributed denial of service attacks, in which attackers flood an application server with millions of concurrent requests that cause server failure. Load balancers can also do the following:

- Monitor traffic and block malicious content
- Automatically redirect attack traffic to multiple backend servers to minimize the impact
- Route traffic through a group of network firewalls for additional security.

__4. Application performance__

Load balancers improve application performance by increasing response time and reducing network latency. They perform several critical tasks such as the following:

- Distribute the load evenly between servers to improve application performance
- Redirect client requests to a geographically closer server to reduce latency
- Ensure the reliability and performance of physical and virtual computing resources
