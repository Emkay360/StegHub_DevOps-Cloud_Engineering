## What is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?
Software Development Life Cycle is the cost-effective and time-efficient process
development teams use to design and build software. The goal is to minimize project
risks through planning so that software meets customer expectations during
production and beyond.

## Importance of SDLC
1. Increased visibility of the project development process to all stakeholders.
2. Efficient planning, estimation, and scheduling.
3. Improved risk management and cost estimation.
4. Systematic software delivery and better customer satisfaction.

## How does SDLC work?
SDLC outlines several tasks required to build software to build a software application.
The development process goes through several stages as developers add new
features and fix bugs in the software.
The details of the process vary for different teams. However, we outlined some
common SDLC phases below.

### Plan
The planning phase typically includes cost-benefit analysis, scheduling, resource
estimation, and allocation. The development team collects requirements from
stakeholders such as customers, internal and external experts, and managers to create a
software requirement specification document.
The document sets expectations and defines common goals that aid in project planning.
The team estimates costs, creates a schedule, and has a detailed plan to achieve their
goals.

### Design
In the design phase, software engineers analyze requirements and identify the best
solutions to create the software. For example, they may consider integrating pre-existing
modules, make technology choices and identify development tools. They will look at how
to best integrate the new software into the organization's existing IT infrastructure.

### Implement
In the implementation phase, the development team codes the product. They analyze
the requirements to identify smaller coding tasks they can do daily to achieve the final
result.

### Test
The development team combines automation and manual testing to check the software
for bugs. Quality analysis includes testing the software for errors and checking if it meets
customer requirements. Because many teams immediately test their code, the testing
phase often runs parallel to the development phase.

### Deploy
When teams develop software, they code and test on a different copy of the software
than the one that the users have access to. The software customers use is called
production, while other copies are said to be in the build or testing environments.
Having separate build and production environments ensures that customers can
continue to use the software even while it is being changed or upgraded. The
deployment phase includes several tasks to move the latest build copy to the production
environment, such as packaging, environment configuration, and installation.

### Maintain
In the maintenance phase, among other tasks, the team fixes bugs, resolves customer
issues, and manages software changes. In addition, the team monitors overall system
performance, security, and user experience to identify new ways to improve the existing
software.

## What are SDLC models?
A software development lifecycle (SDLC) model conceptually presents SDLC in an
organized fashion to help organizations implement it. Different models arrange the
SDLC phases in varying chronological order to optimize the development cycle. We
look at some popular SDLC models below.

### Waterfall
The waterfall model arranges all the phases sequentially so that each new phase
depends on the outcome of the previous phase. Conceptually, the design flows from
one phase down to the next, like that of a waterfall.

*Pros* and *cons*
The waterfall model provides discipline to project management and gives a tangible
output at the end of each phase. However, there is little room for change once a
phase is considered complete, as changes can affect the software's delivery time,
cost, and quality. Therefore, the model is most suitable for small software
development projects, where tasks are easy to arrange and manage and
requirements can be pre-defined accurately.

### Iterative
The iterative process suggests that teams begin software development with a small
subset of requirements. Then, they iteratively enhance versions over time until the
complete software is ready for production. The team produces a new software
version at the end of each iteration.

*Pros* and *cons*
Itâ€™s easy to identify and manage risks, as requirements can change between
iterations. However, repeated cycles could lead to scope change and
underestimation of resources.

### Spiral
The spiral model combines the iterative model's small repeated cycles with the
waterfall model's linear sequential flow to prioritize risk analysis. You can use the
spiral model to ensure the software's gradual release and improvement by building
prototypes at each phase.

*Pros* and *cons*
The spiral model is suitable for large and complex projects that require frequent
changes. However, it can be expensive for smaller projects with a limited scope.

### Agile
The agile model arranges the SDLC phases into several development cycles. The
team iterates through the phases rapidly, delivering only small, incremental software
changes in each cycle. They continuously evaluate requirements, plans, and results
so that they can respond quickly to change. The agile model is both iterative and
incremental, making it more efficient than other process models.

*Pros* and *cons*
Rapid development cycles help teams identify and address issues in complex
projects early on and before they become significant problems. They can also
engage customers and stakeholders to obtain feedback throughout the project
lifecycle. However, overreliance on customer feedback could lead to excessive scope
changes or end the project midway.

## How does SDLC address security?
In traditional software development, security testing was a separate process from
the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The security team discovered security
flaws only after they had built the software. This led to a high number of bugs that
remained hidden as well as increased security risks.
Today, most teams recognize that security is an integral part of the software
development lifecycle. You can address security in SDLC following DevSecOps
practices and conducting security assessments during the entire SDLC process.
